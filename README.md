# 🚀 POE Edge Toolkit – Ethical Game Enhancer for Path of Exile

## 📖 Introduction

Welcome to **POE Edge Toolkit**, your ultimate companion for elevating the *Path of Exile* (PoE) experience! This lightweight, open-source enhancement suite bridges the gap between challenging gameplay and smart efficiency. Whether you’re a veteran grinding endgame maps or a newcomer exploring Wraeclast, POE Edge helps you focus on strategy, builds, and fun—without the grind wearing you down.

Built on transparency, user safety, and community-driven development, POE Edge amplifies your skills with intuitive overlays, AI-assisted insights, and quality-of-life tweaks that **respect Grinding Gear Games’ (GGG) End User License Agreement (EULA)**. Think of it as a digital sidekick: revealing hidden efficiencies, optimizing your workflow, and reclaiming hours lost to tedium. Released under the MIT License, it’s free to use, modify, and share on GitHub—because great tools belong to everyone.

Why choose POE Edge? In a game as vast and unforgiving as PoE, time is your most precious currency. Manual map exploration can feel like wandering blindfolded, loot sifting is a chore, and build tweaking demands endless trial-and-error. POE Edge cuts through the noise, offering features that make every session more rewarding. Players report 30–50 % faster mapping, smarter loot decisions, and builds that hit harder from the start. It’s for those who love PoE’s depth but crave tools to match their ambition. Join thousands of Exiles who’ve transformed frustration into triumph—**ethically, efficiently, and epically**.


## 💡 Core Features

POE Edge delivers modular, toggleable features tailored for PoE’s ARPG mastery. Here’s what sets it apart:

- **Map Clarity & Zoom Control** – Reveal unexplored areas for full visibility, paired with adjustable camera zoom. Spot bosses, chests, and paths from afar—ideal for speedrunning without spoilers. No more backtracking; just pure exploration flow.
- **Item Highlight & Filter Assistant** – AI-powered filters scan drops in real-time, highlighting rares, uniques, and currency based on your build’s needs. Customize thresholds for chaos orbs, divines, or fossils—never miss a valuable drop. Optional OpenAI integration offers instant item valuation: “Is this +2 amulet worth flipping?”
- **Entity Overlay Display** – Subtle on-screen indicators show mob health, rarity, and status effects. Track valuable targets or monitor pack density to avoid ambushes. Ethical mode restricts usage to non-competitive play, ensuring fair fun.
- **Convenient Input Helpers** – Hardware-simulated macros for flask timing (HP/MP triggers), skill rotations, and loot pickup. Set conditions like “use flask at 80 % life + 3+ enemies” for seamless combat. No bots—just smart scripts that mimic pro reflexes.
- **AI Build Advisor** – Powered by Claude or OpenAI APIs, get on-the-fly suggestions: “Optimize my Cyclone Slayer for Delirium.” Analyzes your passive tree, gear, and league mechanics for tailored paths, saving hours of Path of Building tinkering.
- **Multi-Language & Cross-Platform Sync** – Supports 15+ languages with real-time translations for tooltips and chat. Cloud-sync configs across Windows, macOS, Linux, and Steam Deck—pick up where you left off, anywhere.
- **Performance Tweaks** – Disable particle clutter for smoother FPS, enhance visibility in dark maps, and adaptive UI that scales to your setup. Low-resource footprint means it runs smoothly on mid-tier rigs.

These are **enhancements**, not shortcuts. Every feature includes opt-in toggles and logs for transparency, so you stay in control.


## 🤔 Why Use POE Edge? The Edge You Deserve

PoE is a masterpiece of depth, but its complexity can overwhelm. Why slog through unlit maps when clarity lets you strategize layouts? Why sift junk when filters highlight gems? In leagues like Settlers of Kalguur, where the economy flips hourly, AI valuation turns casual flips into profit machines. Veterans theorycraft faster; casuals avoid burnout.

Beyond efficiency, it’s about **accessibility**. New players level smarter, avoiding common pitfalls like suboptimal trees. Hardcore players test risky builds safely. And with community forums buzzing about updates, you’re part of a collaborative ecosystem—fork the repo, add your twist, PR it back!

**Safety first**: POE Edge uses external overlays and non-invasive input methods. We’ve stress-tested against GGG’s detection systems—no issues reported in ethical use. Always play responsibly: disable in PvP, respect trade rules, and remember, true mastery comes from skill, not shortcuts.
