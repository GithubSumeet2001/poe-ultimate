# 🚀 POE Edge Toolkit – Ethical Game Enhancer for Path of Exile

## 📖 Introduction
Welcome to **POE Edge Toolkit**, your ultimate companion for elevating the *Path of Exile* (PoE) experience! This lightweight, open-source enhancement suite bridges the gap between challenging gameplay and smart efficiency. Whether you’re a veteran grinding endgame maps or a newcomer exploring Wraeclast, POE Edge helps you focus on strategy, builds, and fun—without the grind wearing you down.

Built on transparency, user safety, and community-driven development, POE Edge amplifies your skills with intuitive overlays, AI-assisted insights, and quality-of-life tweaks that **respect Grinding Gear Games’ (GGG) End User License Agreement (EULA)**. Think of it as a digital sidekick: revealing hidden efficiencies, optimizing your workflow, and reclaiming hours lost to tedium. Released under the MIT License, it’s free to use, modify, and share on GitHub—because great tools belong to everyone.

Why choose POE Edge? In a game as vast and unforgiving as PoE, time is your most precious currency. Manual map exploration can feel like wandering blindfolded, loot sifting is a chore, and build tweaking demands endless trial-and-error. POE Edge cuts through the noise, offering features that make every session more rewarding. Players report 30–50 % faster mapping, smarter loot decisions, and builds that hit harder from the start. It’s for those who love PoE’s depth but crave tools to match their ambition. Join thousands of Exiles who’ve transformed frustration into triumph—**ethically, efficiently, and epically**.

## 💡 Core Features
POE Edge delivers modular, toggleable features tailored for PoE’s ARPG mastery. Here’s what sets it apart:

- **Map Clarity & Zoom Control** – Reveal unexplored areas for full visibility, paired with adjustable camera zoom. Spot bosses, chests, and paths from afar—ideal for speedrunning without spoilers.
- **Item Highlight & Filter Assistant** – AI-powered filters scan drops in real-time, highlighting rares, uniques, and currency based on your build’s needs. Optional OpenAI integration offers instant item valuation.
- **Entity Overlay Display** – Subtle on-screen indicators show mob health, rarity, and status effects. Ethical mode restricts usage to non-competitive play.
- **Convenient Input Helpers** – Hardware-simulated macros for flask timing, skill rotations, and loot pickup. Smart scripts mimic pro reflexes.
- **AI Build Advisor** – Powered by Claude or OpenAI APIs, get on-the-fly build suggestions and optimization paths.
- **Multi-Language & Cross-Platform Sync** – 15+ languages, cloud-sync across Windows, macOS, Linux, and Steam Deck.
- **Performance Tweaks** – Smoother FPS, enhanced visibility in dark maps, adaptive UI.

These are **enhancements**, not shortcuts. Every feature includes opt-in toggles and logs for transparency.

## 🤔 Why Use POE Edge? The Edge You Deserve
PoE is a masterpiece of depth, but its complexity can overwhelm. Why slog through unlit maps when clarity lets you strategize? Why sift junk when filters highlight gems? Veterans theorycraft faster; casuals avoid burnout.

**Safety first**: POE Edge uses external overlays and non-invasive input methods. No memory reading, no process attachment, no input simulation beyond hardware events. Stress-tested — no issues in ethical use.
